# workout-assistant
This application generates workouts based on the goals, fitness level, desired intensity, and equipment available to the user. It also has the capacity to store a user's workouts, allowing them to revisit a past exercise routine. In the case where a user is unfamiliar with an exercise, or desires a different variation or alternative, they can access the workout guide to inform them on proper technique and optional variations.

This app does not contain an exhaustive list of exercises and the information is somewhat limited in scope. Additional information, graphics, links, and videos could be added to improve its overall capabilities. Additionally, the addition of a proper database, backend server, and user authentication would be needed to complete the site.

I built this application to improve my skills with Nuxt.js, Vuetify.js, and statically generated website implementation.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
